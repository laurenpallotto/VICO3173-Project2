<!--Blurb-->
<div id="blurb">
    <p>Back in 2017, I was fortunate enough to take a trip with my family to visit my older brother at college. He was in his first year at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardiff. My brother took us all ocer the city to some of hos favorite places that he had gone to during his first few months of college. The entire trip was surreal as we spent some time in the city and contry side durring our 10 days there. With all of the different places that we went on the trip, these are my top 5 favorite. These ar ethe palces that I felt a connection with when I was there and would encourage anyone to add them to their trip. </p>
